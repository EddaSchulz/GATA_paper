## Abstract
X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) balances gene expression between the sexes in female mammals. Shortly after fertilization, upregulation of Xist RNA from one X chromosome initiates XCI, leading to chromosome-wide gene silencing. XCI is maintained in all cell types, except the germ line and the pluripotent state where XCI is reversed. The mechanisms triggering Xist upregulation have remained elusive. In our study, we identify GATA transcription factors (TFs) as potent activators of Xist. Through a pooled CRISPR activation screen in murine embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that GATA1, as well as other GATA TFs can drive ectopic Xist expression. Moreover, we describe GATA-responsive regulatory elements in the Xist locus bound by different GATA factors. Finally we show that GATA factors are essential for XCI induction in mouse preimplantation embryos. Deletion of GATA1/4/6 or GATA-responsive Xist enhancers in mouse zygotes effectively prevents Xist upregulation. We propose that the activity or complete absence of various GATA family members controls initial Xist upregulation, XCI maintenance in extraembryonic lineages and XCI reversal in the epiblast.
